  <abstract-data|<\abstract>
    Coral Bells is a friendly yet innovative mobile application designed to
    enhance public safety and community wellbeing through an empathetic and
    holistic approach. Tailored to meet the needs of diverse users\Vstudents,
    parents, individuals with accessibility needs, and those feeling uneasy
    about travelling\Vthe app seamlessly integrates real-time open government
    data with crowd-sourced reports to offer personalised safety guidance for
    everybody.\ 

    Inspired by the resilient Coral Bells flower, our app embodies a vision
    of community empowerment and mutual support. The \Praise the bell\Q
    feature invites users to contribute safety reports and express concerns,
    fostering a sense of shared responsibility and enhancing collective
    security. By leveraging a broad range of data, including bushfire
    boundaries, traffic patterns, and crocodile sightings, Coral Bells
    provides comprehensive and actionable insights, aligning with both
    community priorities and government constraints.

    Our approach extends to advocating for improved data access for
    vulnerable groups, seeking to uncover and address previously invisible
    concerns. The app's design promotes a connected, resilient community,
    reflecting our commitment to safety, comfort, and proactive civic
    engagement. Coral Bells not only supports informed decision-making and
    regional development but also aims to boost local tourism, demonstrating
    that a thriving society is built on empathy, safety, and collaborative
    effort.

  <section*|Introduction>

  Coral Bells embodies a friendly and innovative approach to public safety
  and community engagement, aimed at addressing both immediate and long-term
  needs. Our mobile app integrates open government data with crowd-sourced
  reports to provide personalised safety recommendations, fostering a
  supportive and proactive community, by letting users plan their journey
  safely, and reporting safety/comfort incidents (\Praise the bell\Q). This
  summary outlines our strategic vision, the app's unique contributions, and
  its alignment with government priorities and constraints.

  <section*|Holistic Approach to Safety and Comfort>

  Coral Bells is designed to enhance safety and comfort across diverse
  scenarios, from students travelling late at night to individuals with
  accessibility needs. By integrating real-time data on crocodile sightings,
  bushfire boundaries, traffic patterns, and crowd-sourced safety incidents
  (\Pbells\Q), the app offers a comprehensive view of safety that helps users
  make informed decisions, presented with an easy-to-use, natural-language
  interface. This holistic approach ensures that all aspects of journey
  safety are considered, providing a well-rounded solution that aligns with
  community and government priorities.

  <section*|Empowering Community Engagement>

  At the core of Coral Bells is the belief that community engagement is
  essential for effective safety management. The app's \Praise the bell\Q
  feature enables users to report safety concerns and contribute to a shared
  pool of information. Recognising these contributions through in-app
  gratitude and rewards encourages ongoing participation and fosters a
  culture of mutual support. This proactive engagement helps to build a
  stronger, more connected community.

  <section*|Building and Integrating New Data>

  Coral Bells leverages existing open government data while advocating for
  increased access to information about vulnerable and marginalised groups.
  We recommend that governments and organisations provide such data to
  identify and address previously invisible concerns. By integrating diverse
  data sources, Coral Bells creates a richer understanding of safety and
  wellbeing, supporting targeted interventions and informed policy-making.

  <section*|Aligning with Government Priorities>

  Our app is designed with a keen awareness of government constraints and
  priorities. By providing valuable insights into community safety and
  wellbeing, Coral Bells supports strategic decision-making and policy
  development. The app's AI-powered dashboard offers actionable insights and
  trends, enabling governments to respond effectively to emerging issues and
  align with community needs.

  <section*|Innovative Wellbeing Measurement>

  Coral Bells goes beyond traditional safety solutions by offering a holistic
  view of community wellbeing. The app's data analysis capabilities reveal
  connections between safety incidents and broader wellbeing factors, helping
  to identify and address underlying issues. This approach supports the
  development of new wellbeing indicators and enhances the overall
  understanding of how safety impacts quality of life.

  <section*|Supporting Regional Development and Tourism:>

  The app also contributes to regional development by fostering safe
  exploration and by virtue, boosting local tourism. By instilling confidence
  in users about the safety of new areas, particularly in regions like the
  Northern Territory, Coral Bells encourages travel and supports local
  economies. Data-driven insights further aid in developing strategies for
  regional growth and infrastructure improvements.

  <section*|Conclusion>

  Coral Bells represents a forward-thinking solution to public safety and
  community engagement. By adopting a holistic approach, empowering community
  contributions, and advocating for comprehensive data access, the app aligns
  with government priorities and addresses both immediate and long-term
  needs. We are committed to making our users\Vour corals\V feel safe,
  comfortable, included, and <with|font-shape|italic|represented>.
